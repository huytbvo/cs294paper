\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have presented an automatic pipeline synthesis tool intended to
improve designer productivity by reducing the time spent writing
RTL. Our tool allows users to write a datapath without worrying about
the pipelining logic since the pipeline specification is kept separate
from the datapath. We also expect to improve design space exploration
since the same datapath can be combined with different pipeline
specifications to produce different design points. Currently, we can
use our tool to generate a 2, 3, 4, and 5 stage processor and resolve
pipelining hazards through interlocks, speculation and bypassing. Our
results show that we have very little overhead for small pipelines but
this overhead increases as we increase the pipelining depth due to
larger degree of freedom for pipeline placement and an increase in
pipeline hazards. 

In future work, we plan on improving our pipeline register placement and bypass network generation. Potentially, we could integrate a retiming tool with our pipeline register placement process, in order to figure out the where to place the pipeline registers such that we get the shortest critical path. We also hope to implement more fine grained ways to specify bypassing, such as as letting the user choose exactly which pipeline stages they want each write path to be bypassed from. Additionally, we also plan on trying out our tool on different processors.
