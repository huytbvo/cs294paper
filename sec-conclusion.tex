\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have presented an automatic pipeline synthesis tool intended to
improve designer productivity by reducing the time spent writing
RTL. Our tool allows users to write a datapath without worrying about
the pipelining logic since the pipeline specification is kept separate
from the datapath. We also expect to improve design space exploration
since the same datapath can be combined with different pipeline
specifications to produce different design points. Currently, we can
use our tool to generate a 2, 3, 4, and 5 stage processor and resolve
pipelining hazards through interlocks, speculation and bypassing. Our
results show that we have very little overhead for small pipelines but
this overhead increases as we increase the pipelining depth due to
larger degree of freedom for pipeline placement and an increase in
pipeline hazards. 

In future work, we plan on improving our pipeline register placement
and bypass network generation. We also plan on trying out our tool on
different processors.
