\begin{abstract}
We augment Chisel to allow for the specification of a datapath to be
separated from the specification of how to pipeline that datapath. The
pipeline specification allows for the designer to specify the pipeline
depth, placement of pipeline registers, and how to resolve pipeline
hazards. We created an automatic tool that combines the two
specifications and generates a pipelined implementation of the
datapath by performing transformations on the the Chisel Node graph.
